this a test for rebase
This line was added in the master branch
this is the first commit made in the dev branch
this the second commit made in the dev branch
And now it's time to push on the dev branch     
first commit after merge       
second commit after merge // Add some text here        
time to make a new rebase     
And finally try to make a nice rebase      
Take care!
